# Noita Sweat

Noita sweat is a VR-only mod for Noita that adds "physical" controller bindnigs for the Rift S. In order to play Noita Sweat, you can't simply sit in your chair and use the analog sticks and buttons on the rift controllers. Instead, your right hand becomes your wand, aiming in the direction you're pointing. Your left hand becomes your movement controls, requiring you to steer through the laberyth. 

## How it works

Noita Sweat works by creating a virtual "controller" for noita. The directional controls and aim are bound to a "virtual controller."

 In front of the players left arm, a 3x3 grid of "zones" are created, corresponding to 8 directional inputs. By holding the left wand in the correct zone and squeezing the left trigger, the game will recieve movement inputs from the corresponding direction. 
 
 For wand aim, an "axis" is created extending out of the players right elbow. A virtual "right stick" is defined as being pointed in the angle the right pointer makes with the axis, as projected onto the "screen."
